# Beginner SPO Exam Purpose

I've created an exam with the most important question which an SPO should be able to answer ad-hoc. Every question contains some explanation and links to learning resources explaining the according topic.
Use this before you start your pool to check your knowledge and see I've you are already deep enough in the topic. The exam should let you identify knowledge gaps if there are some.
Motivation: I've see similar questions popping up every day including some misbeliefs which may be critical if you are planning to set up your own stake pool. I though an exam would be a nice format to transport the according knowledge in an easy consumable format.
The average Exam time is 10 minutes.You do not get any badge or similar. It's just for yourself. The test is anonymous but you can share your ticker if you want.
I'd like to thank "waldmops" for reviewing the questions and giving great inputs reflecting his great experience!

(Question): I'm currently planning to host my Infrastructure. The following are valid hosting options.
(choose 3 of 4)
(A): I host on a VPS provider which takes care on availability relevant considerations.
(B): I'm planning to combine a private and cloud hosting. I will avoid a single point of failure for the Block Producer through a failover strategy.
(C): I host my servers at private locations and take care on availability relevant considerations myself including battery backed power, high-available network, backup, redundant internet .. myself. 
(D): I run it in Virtual Machines on my Desktop Computer which I only run when I'm, working.
(Correct): A,B,C
(Points): 1
(CF): Running a self hosted environment is a valid option if you are able to handle all security and availability related aspects. Having a variety of hosting locations is important for decentralization. Anyways there are several concerns which are really hard to achieve at home. If there is a power outage even your battery backup will not keep your server alive forever. Without a split to multiple physical locations super high availability is not possible.

(Question): Which are possible strategies to protect a server from DDOS Attacks?
(Choose 3 of 4)
(A): Only expose the service to peers which you know.
(B): Run a private relay which is not announced to the network and therefore cannot be exploited.
(C): Place the service behind a WAF
(D): The Cardano Node has a built in protection to mitigate DDOS Attacks
(Correct): A,B,C
(Points): 1
(CF): Having a private relay does not allow an attacker to explicitly target all relays of your pool and would keep your Block producer connected in an attack scenario.

Only exposing the server to known peers is possible but also limits the decentralization potential since and the administrative overhead is high.

P2P extensions of the Cardano Node will also make this approach obsolete.

A WAF (Web Application Firewall) maybe be a possible solution but requires according training.

(D): My pool lost delegators since the block was assigned
(Correct): A,B,C

If time is not synced the block might be produced to late and not be accepted by the network any more. 

If the KES is expired the signing is simply not possible and the block is lost for your pool.

Safety of Funds: The maximum loss a delegator can have is the rewards which will not be paid because of a missing pledge if the attacker moves the operators funds out.

Same Rewards on every Pool: The rewards formula considers pledge. Additionally the fixed cost eats into rewards heavily in low saturated pools.

(Question): To ensure a good pool performance I want to achieve high availability. How can I decrease the risk of an outage?
(Choose 3 of 4)
(A): Eliminate single points of failure in the infrastructure.
(B): Make sure an operator is notified if one of the servers is out of service.
(C): Implement a failover strategy for the Block Producers.
(D): Implement a failover strategy for the Relays.
(Correct): A,B,C
(Points): 1
(CF): Single points of failure need to be eliminated on all levels. This includes redundant internet, redundant power, multiple physical locations, redundant storage. If a node fails another one needs to continue the work. In case of a Relay outage another relay still needs to remain active. In case of a Block Producer outage a failover should take over the task. This can be implemented through a live migration or switchover to a hot standby. Also spinning up a new instance based on a template is possible but comes with the downside of a not-synchronized database which will cause quite some lead time and therefore a risk to miss blocks.

Monitoring needs to include hardware resource usage (CPU, MEM, Storage), service availability. An integrative check (Database synced withing a specifice timeframe) may be helpful to identify software issues ore network related issues which are not in the control of the single machine.

Ralays to not need a failover strategy. They simply should run all at the same time. Running multiple relays is important to make sure propagation of generated blocks is running smoothly and distributed to as many pools as possible.
